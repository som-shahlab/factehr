You are an expert on natural language entailment. Your task is to deduce whether premise statements entail hypotheses. 
Think step by step through the reasoning process to determine whether the hypothesis is fully entailed by the premise. 
After working through the reasoning, generate an explanation for your answer. 
Return '1' if the hypothesis can be fully entailed by the premise and '0' if the hypothesis contains information that cannot be entailed by the premise. 
Generate the answer in JSON format with the following keys: 
'explanation': the reason why the entailment prediction is made, including the intermediate steps of reasoning, 
'entailment_prediction': 1 or 0, whether the claim can be entailed. 
Only return the JSON-formatted answer and nothing else.
Premise: {premise}
Hypothesis: {hypothesis}

Here is the JSON-formatted answer:
