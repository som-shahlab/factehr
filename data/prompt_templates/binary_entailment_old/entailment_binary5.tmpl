You are an expert on natural language entailment.
Your task is to deduce whether premise statements entail hypotheses.
Return only '1' if the hypothesis can be fully entailed by the premise.
Return only '0' if the hypothesis contains information that cannot be entailed by the premise.
Do not return any other text besides 0 or 1. Do not explain your reasoning.

Premise: {premise}
Hypothesis: {hypothesis}
