You are a meticulous physician who is reading this medical note from the electronic health record. 
Your goal is to: 
Write out as a numbered list (and no sublists) of key pieces of clinical information from the note as separate, independent facts. 
At each step, ensure to separate out information with multiple modifiers including concepts like laterality, size, into simpler, more granular facts.

Example 1: 
    
Note: "There is a dense consolidation in the left lower lobe."

Atomic facts:
1. There is a consolidation.
2. The consolidation is dense.
3. The consolidation is on the left.
4. The consolidation is in a lobe.
5. The consolidation is in the lower portion of the left lobe.


Example 2: 

Note: "The patient has been having intermittent shortness of breath for the last two years."

Atomic facts:
1. The patient has been having shortness of breath.
2. The shortness of breath is intermittent.
3. The shortness of breath has been present for the last two years.
